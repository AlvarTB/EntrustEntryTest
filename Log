In order to not lose track of what I'm doing, I've decided to start a log:

1- I have implemented a basicAb: this one simply makes a request and returns tps, latency and whether it was a failure or not.

2- I am implementing the actual ab.
26/1 21:51-> added the -n flag recognition
	Turns out that in order to make it work you have to use:
	go run . <address> -n 100
	instead of the expected
	go run . -n 100  <address>

	I will look onto that later.

27/1 11:00-> Started to work on the -n actual implementation.
		Once I am done with this I want to clean the code and
		udate the readme with the results of exercise 1
		I also want to add some error handling routines.

	12:15 -> I can't seem to get the flag to business work. I'm not sure what is wrong. Reference: https://gobyexample.com/command-line-flags
	12:44 -> Finally made it work. I also managed to put the flags in their
	right places. Now I have to make it so it sends the number of requests
	I specify.
	17:00 -> The -n flag seems to be working fine. Now I'm going to improve the code documentation and work into some error handling aspects. I will also need to work in the readme a little bit more.
